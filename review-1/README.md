### Overview
Customer needs Opening statement I work for an School Reports company. We help teachers to find out how their students did on tests. We get a string of comma separated values with test results from schools, and weâ€™d like you to build a simple report on top of that.


Create an application which takes in a comma ',' separated string of results. It prints a summary which totals each result.

string = Green, Green, Amber, Red, Green
Output = Green: 3 Amber: 1 Red: 1
